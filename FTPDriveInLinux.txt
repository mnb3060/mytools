#Since we do not want to put any passwords in the /etc/fstab file, we will first create a /root/.netrc file with a ftp username and password using this format:
  nano /root/.netrc
    machine my-ftp-location.local
    login ftp-user
    password ftp-pass
# Next, change permissions of this file to 600:
# 
chmod 600 /root/.netrc
#Check uid and gid of your non-root user. This user will have access to ftp mount directory:

#In the next step add the following line to your /etc/fstab file ( change credentials for your ftp user ):
  curlftpfs#my-ftp-location.local /mnt/my_ftp fuse allow_other,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022 0 0
#Now mount the remote FTP directory with:
mount -a
